	kerning

2008-11-30 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Kerning for Latin and Cyrillic fairly complete in Serif faces.
	Complete in sense that it looks pretty good under Pango for
		English French German Spanish Polish Czech Latvian
	But have not done Vietnamese (will require many more entries).
	I adjust roman and italic, then copy tables by hand to bold and
	bolditalic.
	Misgiving: bolditalic is much too crammed
	Overall, I may have over-kerned.  (A difficult temptation to master.)

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	kerning

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	regularized padding in Miscellaneous symbols.
	At least within related ranges tried to make similar.

	Unicode Symbols, and some of mine.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Replaced Greek Exteded psili and dasia with scaled versions of the
	"bent quote" mark.  I think it's distinctive enough, but not so silly.
	
	Remedies bug #22997: Mono: Greek Extended psili is ugly
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22997

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Made some recycling symbols

	* FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd:

	Made Cyrillic hooked e U+04BC-F to look less goofy.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Based on assertion on Pechatnyj Dvor's web site, Cyrillic Fita
	U+0472-3 and "Barred O" U+04E8-9 are different styles the same letter,
	and the fact that the tilde in the O never looked good in Sans, I
	made them all barred O's.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added Cyrillic Yn, yn (U+a65e-f)

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Experimenting with mark positioning for Cyrillic

2008-11-12 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Strove to make Euro look more like the EC logo design, while making
	glyph fit better with the design of its face.  Bug #3576: Euro design
		https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?23576

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Adjustments mostly to GPOS tables having to do with Vietnamese marks.
	The WAZU Vietnamese test page looks pretty good in Sans now.
	Still not thrilled with below-dot when it appears with a mark over
	e.g. U+0102. Pango positions one or the other but not both.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Extensive modification of GPOS lookup tables for mark positioning.
	I think they're now all functional (except styled Mono faces have none).
	Also added lots of marks to faces that didn't have them, and also
	fiddled with Combining Diacritical Marks.

2008-11-10 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Made one combining mark really combining

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Made a few combining characters to be zero-width in Mono,
	Added them to other styles.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Figured out why below marks in Thai weren't working in the lowest
	letters.  I think Pango and other font renderers ignore 'blwm'. 
	However, 'mark' works.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Tweeks to Thai marks

2008-11-09 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Several bugfixes in Thai, mostly having to do with mark placement and
	ligatures.  Implemented ru-saraaa and lu-saraaa with ligatures.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	added and named dottedcircle (used by Pango to render
	combining mark base)

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Tweeks to Coptic, after viewing more papyrus samples and web pages.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Weight of Coptic small letters made to match that of Latin and Greek ones.

2008-11-08 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Made Coptic to comply better with
		http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Test_Coptic.html
	Made a flourish at foot of letters with long diagonal.

	More tweeks to Coptic; put in a mark lookup table.
	
	Note: for small letters I made scaled references to captials.
	Results in those letters looking quite light next to the capitals and
	next to small Latin letters.  Also, there are a few variant forms for
	capitals (Unicode samples don't show this).  It would be good to
	re-work

	Added Coptic alphabet in u+2C80-2CB1 and u+03E2-u+03EF, drawn/built by
	me, based on Unicode samples, TeX font copte, and scans at WikiPedia.

2008-11-07 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Further tweeks to dieresis in Greek and Cyrillic

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	replaced Greek I dieresis with references, tweeked height of dieresis.

2008-11-04 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added a few Cyrillic Extended-B letters seen in web pages while looking
	for Glagolitic text.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Added a few old Cyrillic characters.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Several corrections and tweeks to Glagolitic.
	Still missing six slots from Unicode, but don't see them in the TeX
	fonts.
	On the other hand, several on-line Glagolitic pages (bibles etc) don't
	seem to use these.  Maybe it's OK as-is.

2008-11-03 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added lowercase range to Glagolitic, as a facile scaling of the
	uppercase.

	Added letter to Glagolitic, scaled range.

2008-11-02 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Replaced fraktur bold from Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols with that
	from TX Fonts by Young Ryu.
	One concern: letter k is damaged (in both medium and bold).  I just
	hacked something up.
	
	Added Glagolitic "round type" font (Croation capitols only) from the
	collection of Croatian fonts for LaTeX by Darko Zubrinić
	ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/languages/croatian/
	http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb17-1/tb50zubr.pdf
	
	Several letters are missing besides the small letters.

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	A couple of Thai references got obliqued twice.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	By popular demand, removed 'ears' from Greek Upsilon and Psi.
	Copied resulting glyphs to Serif Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Some pointwise cleanup of main Tamil range

	Tried some things with lookups.  Didn't make much headway.

2008-11-01 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd:

	somehow made a letter with wrong width

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Added similar lookups and ligatures to Thai ranges.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Lookups now work no worse than those for other Thai fonts, at least
	in Pango.  Still perplexed by behaviour of "Required" lookups.

	For Thai, made ligatures and lookups for yoying and thothan combined
	with a lower vowel.  These work well.
	Attempted looksups for saraaa with ru and lu, and for saraam. 
	Not working.

	Cleaned up a few of the Bengali ligatures

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd:

	Tweek Thai

2008-10-31 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fixed ligatures and mark positioning for Hanunóo.
	Problem with ligatures: Gnome pango doesn't do 'rlig', only 'liga'

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Changed lookup table scripts for Devanagari and Bengali.
	Find Problems -> ATT found several problems showing lookups acting on
	glyphs that weren't listed in the script ranges, including dev2, bng2
	(why not deva and beng, I don't know).
	
	danda and doubledanda of Devanagari I understand are to be shared among
	Indic scripts.  So included bng2 and dev2 in the 'aalt' table for those.
	
	The 'init' and 'half' tables for Bengali made active for bng2.
	
	The 'locl' table for Bengali didn't do anything I could see: It mapped
	the Devanagari danda to itself, and the doubledanda to itself.  Deleted.

	Cleaned up some kern tables.
	adjustments of under 5 EM are invisible.  Some others I just didn't like.
	Some were putting a letter beneath another, with is wrong.

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Added Thai

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Changes to mark positioning lookups, esp. in Italic.
	Widened numerals in Bold

2008-10-27 Stevan_White
	* FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Tweeks regarding Armenian and lookups

	* FreeSansBold.sfd:

	Added Armenian ligatures FB13-FB17 with lookups
	Also made a historical ligature ('hlig') table for u+0587.
	
	Toward bug #15183: missing characters from Armenian range
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?15183

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Added Armenian ligatures, lookups.  Cleaned up contours.

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Added 5 Armenian ligatures to U+FB13 – FB17, and made corresponding
	'liga' lookup.  Found there one ligature u+0587 that according to
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_alphabet
	
	"in new orthography the և character is not a typographical ligature anymore, and must never be treated as such. It is a distinct letter and has its place in the new alphabetic sequence."
	So moved this out of the 'liga' lookup and into a new 'hlig' lookup.

2008-10-26 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Lots of improvements to Thai.
	Completely revised letter spacing in Italic, and fiddled with combining
	marks in all.
	Still aren't working quite right, especially in Italic.
	Still need to work over digits (in Bold they aren't even bold yet)

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Bold Thai : added (painstakingly) constructed glyphs, lookups
	roman Thai: tweeks
	Italic Thai: tweeks (Note this still has multiple problems)

2008-10-25 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	WAZU says
	http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Hanunoo.html
	
	MPH 2B Damase doesn't support the consonant-vowel ligatures necessary
	to render Buhid writing.
	
	OK, so I made 'mark' lookups for combining marks and a bunch of
	ligatures in an 'rlig' lookup.  The latter still not working:
	don't know why.
	
	Made page to match the example of the combining forms at
	http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hanunoo.htm

2008-10-24 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Removed some marks from Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Tweeked combining marks for Vietnamese.  Made to satisfy
		WAZU JAPAN Comprehensive Unicode Test Page for Vietnamese
		http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Test_Vietnamese.html
	Could still use some tweeking...

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added marks for composition of Vietnamese

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Put "below" combining mark on lots of vowels and derivatives,

2008-09-22 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Filled in as much of Phonetic Extensions as I could without artistic
	abilities.
	Note 1D48-9 are not references due to apparent FontForge bug, that says
	scaled references go in wrong direction.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Cleaup of some Bengali glyphs.
	Note many of the ligatures remain very very messy.

	* Makefile:

	added more validations
	made to work with GenerateOpenType

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added lots of Spacing Modifier Letters and Combining Diacritical Marks.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Wrote script to check if glyph encodings were in stated ranges, fixed
	most discrepancies.
	
	There were a bunch of incompletely deleted characters in several faces.
	
	Sans: found several other problems in the process
	# Tamil
	Four slots labelled 0BDA-D have glyphs, not in Unicode.  also 0BE1
	I think they are misplaced; added 0010 to each of them
	
	# Devanagari
	Slot labelled U+093B is not in Unicode--can't find glyph: deleted
	likewise 094F (may have been meant to be 0954)
	0955, 0973-0976
	
	0954 should be a combining mark, but it appears on the wrong side of 0.
	0971 was just wrong--made into simple dot.
	0972 is also wrong--made my own Candra A.
	
	# Gujarati
	Slots labelled 0AE4-5 are not in Unicode; seem not to belong at all.
	Deleted.  2800 is a dup of 2790.  Deleted
	
	Serif: phillipine_double u1736 was misplaced
	
	A bunch of the Math Alphanumeric symbols are empty in the standard,
	because they're represented elsewhere.  These should be deleted
	First need to make style consistent with existing symbols.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Applied patch from Daniel J
	Remedies bug
		FreeSerif: Missing glyphs with palatal hook
		https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?24298
	Adding several letters to Phoenetic Extensions range U+1D80-BF

	Made four characters U+200C-F to be zero-width
	Remedy to bug #23593: Mono 0-width chars: zero-width or space?
		https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?23593

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Made Mahjong tiles to take up less space using references
	Cleaned up several validation problems

2008-09-19 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added several Hebrew Alphabetic Presentation Forms (some easy ones), to
	make its coverage the same as Serif Bold.

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd:

	Re-encoded.
	Deleted several glyphs in Hebrew Alphabetic Presentation Forms that
	didn't correspond valid Unicode

	* FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Ran script to find mis-numbered glyphs.  Several were simply typos,
	some offset by one.

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Numerous cases of glyphs in Private Use area incorrectly assigned
	Unicode numbers and names.  Gave all -1 for Unicode and named like
	"slot.XXXX".

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Adapted Mahjong Tiles from George Douros' Unicode Symbols font.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added Domino Tiles.  Domino outline is copied from George Douros'
	Unicode Symbols, but the rest I preferred to do with references.

2008-09-18 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Adapted Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols from George Douros' Unicode
	Symbols font.

	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd:

	This one got away from me--I don't know what I did.
	Looks like some small contour edits.

	* FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd:

	Fixed one mis-numberd character in Latin Extended-B

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Fixed several mis-numbered characters.

	* FreeSansBold.sfd:

	SansBold: one Georgian letter with no name, one Zapf Dingbat was
	unnumbered
	ATT test shows a bunch of problems with Gurmukhi and 'blwf' table
	indeed shows those letters at 0x10000+
	Sans names them like uni0A30_uni0A4D.blwf: they are in range
	ECC6 to ED06
	
	I meant to move this range into Private Use in last release, and
	missed it.  So now it is moved, into same range as Sans.
	
	Both Sans and SansBold in nukt table for Gurmukhi have duplicate
	entries for uni0A15 uni0A3C.  Deleted dups.

	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	fixed a number of Unassigned Code Points in Greek Extended

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	mis-numbered Combining Diacritics

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Several chars in Latin Extended hadn't been named.
	One spurious letter in Letterlike Symbols

2008-09-16 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Lots of additions: unless otherwise noted, they are from George Duros'
	fonts Analecta, Music, and Unicode (haven't got final confirmation of
	the eligibility of these glyphs, so this is just for testing.)
	
	Added some combining marks, fiddled a bit.  In both Serif & Mono, tried
	to get a key symbol characters to fit inside the key combining mark
	
	Serif
	Got rid of ears on Upsilon
	Added:
	        # Gothic
		# Western & Byzantine Musical Symbols
	
		# Misc Symbols, Misc Technical Symbols (drew many myself)
		# Supplemental Symbols and Arrows
	
	Mono
	Added:
		# lotsa Misc Technical Symbols
		# OCR Symbols
		# drew many Supplemental Symbols and Arrows, Misc Technical
	
	Sans
	Added	# Phoenecian
	Made a few Letterlike Symbols; Made Re and Im to be sans-serif.

2008-09-11 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Removed pointless entries from Latin kern table
	
	Tidied points in Sinhala

2008-09-07 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Tidied up Tamil ligatures EEA8-EEAB to fix TT build warning
		"MonotonicFindAlong: Never found our spline."

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, Makefile:

	
	Added APL characters to FreeMono (why?...)
	
	Fixed several last-minute problems, including
	
	Serif: Tweeked GPOS mark table for Cyrillic
	Sans: Added a GPOS table for Cyrillic (but several diacritics missing)
	
	Serif, Mono: tweeked some bugs in extensible brackets & integrals
	
	Serif: Vietnamese o circumflex: accent was a bit high. fixed.
	
	MonoBoldOblique OTF build
		uni213b intersects self
	
	Generation of TT fonts complains about several things to stderr,
	including:
	
	SerifBold: "There exists a 'fpgm' code that seems incompatible with FontForge's. Instructions generated will be of lower quality. If legacy hinting is to be scrapped, it is suggested to clear the `fpgm` and repeat autoinstructing. It will be then possible to append user's code to FontForge's 'fpgm', but due to possible future updates, it is extremely advised to use high numbers for user's functions."
	Probably has been there since I first copied the TT instructions in. 
	Just repeated the copying process carefully, and the warning went away.
	
	Serif:  "FindMatchingHVEdge fell into an impossible position"
	        fixed a bunch of point too close
	
	REMAINING PROBLEM in Serif TT build
		"MonotonicFindAlong: Never found our spline."
		        fixed several bad TT matrices-- there are several more
			fixed many "control points too close" no luck

2008-09-03 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Added/corrected some Misc. Symbols by copying from Serif.
	Note this is only a stopgap solution.  Want real sans-serif symbols.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Added minimal Miscellaneous Symbols: card suites and some musical notes.
	Note not happy with shapes...some I just drew.  Sans isn't really sans.
	
	Fixed one APL symbol in Mono so it verified in OTF version

2008-08-31 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd:

	Built set of APL symbols.

2008-08-30 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Un-linked references in uni02B2 and uni02B5, because when validating the
	TrueType version, FontForge gave an error "is drawn in wrong direction".
	I suspect a bug in FontForge.  Other similar glyphs make no errors.

	Fixed missing extrema in TrueType.
	These were the last cases being reported by validate in all the faces.

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	fixed last missing extrema in TrueType

	* Makefile:

	restructured validation to look in a directory

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fixed missing extrema in TrueType versions

2008-08-15 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Same problem with uni0A83 as with bn_llikaar.  Just made zero-width.

2008-08-14 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Glyph bn_llikaar, U+09E3 BENGALI VOWEL SIGN VOCALIC LL,
	has right bound positioned far into the negative.  Causes a warning in
	FontForge when opening OTF version.
	Comparing with other fonts supporting Bengali, found no others that
	do this.
	Serif makes glyph width 0 (which sounds right according to Unicode)
	and puts glyph wholly to left of 0.  But, I haven't found this letter
	in text anywhere.  I wonder if it is really used in writing.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Further TrueType validation fixes. 
	Sans still has two glyps in wrong direction.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Fixed more TrueType problems...all missing extrema in TTF validation

2008-08-13 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	fixed all the TrueType validation problems of type "intersects itself"
	and all but two of the "wrong directions", as well as a lot of
	"missing extrema".  But there remain hundreds of missing extrema in the
	TrueType version.
	Also, bn_llikaar in Sans and Oblique still has a problem in OTF version.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd:

	Made .ttf files to validate.  Other faces have many more problems still.

2008-08-12 Stevan_White
	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Continuing to make OTF versions validate.
	
	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd:
		lots of missing points at extrema
	* FreeSerif.sfd:
		12 wrong directions, 1 missing extrema
	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:
		many missing points at extrema, 1 self-intersecting
	
	What was wrong: in several oblique cases, an already-italic glyph was
	made more italic, thereby fouling up extrema (although why it passed
	validation in the SFD I don't know).  Some glyphs were
	overly-complicated with many near points.  Cleaned up, rounded to int.
	
	Remaining problem: OTF FreeSansOblique FreeSans. one Bengali glyph in
	each whose advance width and htmx don't match.
	
	Moral of story: validate the OTF and TTF versions too before a release.

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Reverse a mistake from last commit: somehow this file was converted to
	quadratic, or something.

2008-08-11 Stevan_White
	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Found that SFD files that validated produced OpenType files that don't.
	These represent the easy fixes.  Some were result of conversion to
	quadratic; some shouldn't have validated in the SFD...
	
	* MonoBoldOblique: uni0250 missing pts at extrema [reference glyph rotated...]
	* Sans:            uni0AC4 wrong direction [simplified, rounded to int]
	* SansOblique:     uni01EA wrong direction [rounded to int]
	* SerifBold:       uni023f wrong direction [round to int]
	* SerifBoldItalic: uni0245 missing pts at extrema [ungrouped ref, added extrema]

2008-08-06 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Re-set font metrics, which were somehow making uneven vertical spacing.

2008-06-22 Steve White
	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Made to validate

	* ranges.py:

	Brought more into line with OpenType
	Added some ranges
	Fixed bug with ranges outside of font

	* CREDITS:

	3 new ranges

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Cyrillic: tweeked accents for consistency, and for readability in small
	sizes.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Thanna range: tweeking

	Thaana range: Scaled up by about 15%, raised by 100EM, tightened
	some of the diacritics to get inside 900 to -300 EM limits.

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Added Old Persian and Ugaritic from MPH2BDamase font.

2008-06-21 Steve White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added Tai Le range adapted from MPH2BDamase font.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Added some ancient Greek numerals from Tempora to high Unicode area,
	(partly just to show it can now be done.)

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Couple of tweeks putting glyphs above -300EM.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Surgery to Thai letter 'tho than', u+0e10, to push it above -300 EM.
	This makes Thai range completely between 900 and -300 EM.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Many auxilary characters (esp. for Malayalam, Bengla, and Tamil)
	representing ligatures and alternative forms without their own Unicode,
	were moved from
	ranges above 0xFFFF (which ought to have been slots for other defined
	Unicode ranges) into the Private Use area.
	
	In Serif, I segregated the scripts, in Sans it was hard to see where one
	began and another ended, so I moved them en masse.
	
	Note several problems with wrongly-named characters:
	I already re-named glyph570 and glyph582.
	But there are others with names starting with A...

	* FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Fixed (I hope the last) problem with scripts in lookups
	Find Problems -> ATT (all selected) finds multiple issues,
	
	* FreeSansBold.sfd:
	In addition to script 'guru', added 'gur2' to the scripts for these
	lookups
		'nukt' Nukta forms in Gurmukhi

	Set Metrics to recommended values

	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Now Mono Oblique, as well as roman and Bold, are within 800 to -200 EM.
	Just BoldOblique to go.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd:

	More toward fitting to 800 to -200 EM.
	Basically, reduced Georgian by 92%.
	Also made an over-all offset, so Georgian is somehow centered (Bold...I
	guess I already did this in roman).
	Want to also do an emboldening to make stroke like rest of font, but
	current FontForge has a nasty crash that loses data on this function.

	* FreeMono.sfd:

	In effort to make fit in 800 to -200 EM,
	Scaled Georgian by 92%, centered on 600 wide box.
	Next: Embolden a bit.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Started implementing TemporaLCGUni in Greek ranges.
	
	Replaced 3DC-3E1 from Tempora, because I thought they looked nicer and
	more like the other existing FreeFont glyphs.
	Replaced 3DA-B from Tempora, because they look more like Unicode
	samples, and nicer.
	Added 03f3-4, 03F7-F.
	Prefer my own lunate epsilon.
	Replaced Phi and Omega from Tempora.
	These plainly fit the other FreeFont glyphs better than the origninals.
	(How did this happen?)
	
	In bold, replaced U+03D7
	
	Copied lbbar u+2114

	Small italic greek--replaced most except phi, psi, omega

		StemSnapV does not contain StdVW value.
	So I ordered the array, and based on other slanted fonts,

	Got a copy of the original Tikkana font,
	Copied in remaining consonants and vowels that I could find there.
	I think one vowel 0C55 is missing according to unicode).
	Strangely, the Telugu digits are alo missing.
	In Tikkana, the default "checkmark" structural mark is missing from many
	consonants, according to Unicode, but is a separate glyph.  I put
	the checkmark on.
	This, and scaled up by 150% and cleaned up intersecting glyphs and

	Much fiddling with Tamil range.
	First scaled to 78% (avoiding the references)
	This gets it in the ballpark height-wise.  [A bit taller than the Latin
